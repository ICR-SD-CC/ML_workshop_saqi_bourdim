# Installing Anaconda, Launching JupyterLab, and Running a Notebook

## Step 1: Install Anaconda Navigator
1. **Download Anaconda**:
   - Go to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/).
   - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), I think you need to provide your e-mail etc...

2. **Install Anaconda**:
   - Run the downloaded installer.
   - Follow the installation prompts (use the default settings unless you have specific requirements).

   *Note: JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook are installed by default with Anaconda, so you won't need to install them separately.*

## Step 2: Launch JupyterLab (Recommended) or Jupyter Notebook
You have two options to run your notebook: **JupyterLab** (recommended) or **Jupyter Notebook**. While both are excellent, **JupyterLab** is preferred because it offers:
   - Better file navigation.
   - Easier access to subsections within a notebook.
   - More functionalities for advanced workflows.

### Option 1: Use JupyterLab (Recommended)
1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**:
   - Search for "Anaconda Navigator" in your system's search bar and launch it.

2. **Launch JupyterLab**:
   - In the Navigator interface, click **Launch** under JupyterLab.

### Option 2: Use Jupyter Notebook
1. **Open Anaconda Navigator**:
   - Launch Anaconda Navigator.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - In the Navigator interface, click **Launch** under Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Step 3: Open the Notebook
1. **Locate `ml_wshop-2.0-full.ipynb`**:
   - Ensure the notebook file (`ml_wshop-2.0-full.ipynb`) is saved on your computer.

2. **Navigate to the Notebook Directory**:
   - In JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook, use the file browser to navigate to the folder containing the notebook.

3. **Open the Notebook**:
   - Click on `ml_wshop-2.0-full.ipynb` to open it in the interface.
